1. No java solutions required for this one. What are the time complexities for following loops:


// Here is the solution of time complexities for following loops.

// a)

for i = 1 to n

    ...

for i = 1 to n

    ...

solution: O(n)

// b)

for i = 1 to n/2

    ...
solution: O(n)

// c)

x = 1

while x <= n

    x += 1

solution: O(n)

// d)

a = 1

b = n

while a <= b

    a += 1

    b -= 1

 solution: O(n)
